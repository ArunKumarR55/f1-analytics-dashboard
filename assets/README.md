# f1-analytics-dashboard

An interactive Dash/Plotly dashboard for analyzing historical Formula 1 race data (drivers, constructors, and circuits).

### About The Project

This project is an interactive web dashboard for visualizing and exploring historical Formula 1 data. Built with **Python**, **Dash**, and **Plotly**, it allows users to analyze decades of race results, driver performance, and constructor statistics.

The dashboard provides several interactive tabs:

* **Overview:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts for races, host countries, and nationality statistics.
* **Driver Analytics:** Tracks cumulative wins over time and displays top drivers by wins and podiums.
* **Constructor Analytics:** Visualizes cumulative wins and seasonal points for selected constructors.
* **Circuit Analytics:** Shows the most-raced circuits and the top-performing drivers at any selected track.# f1-analytics-dashboard
